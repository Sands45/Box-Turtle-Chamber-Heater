Basic goal of this project is to have a remote accessible chamber heater for the Box Turtle. So it will use Klipper as the OS and Mainsail as the main interface. 

The macro is pretty simple. It's a basic heat soak macro to keep the heater on and at a stable target temp for 25 hrs. An LED with LED_EFFECTS provides basic status. Possible to use simpler LED controls as well (but not provided).
